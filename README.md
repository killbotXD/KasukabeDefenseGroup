# KasukabeDefenseGroup
For Codefundo 2019

- We are planning to build a web application that connects all the polling booths of a city through a blockchain network.
- Users need to enter their Voter ID number and the website will preview the candidates standing in their locality. After which users need to select their prefered candidate and submit that. Every vote polled in the city would be a block of the blockchain.
- Users need to go to any polling booth (within their city)  and just enter their Voter ID number there and submit their choice. Since their choices will be stored as a block in a blockchain  their choices will remain unaltered.
- Dataset that we will be using would be our own, not the one provided by Government.
- Technologies that we will be using - Nodejs, HTML/CSS, JS, MongoDB.
